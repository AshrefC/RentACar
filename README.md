Car Rental Platform (In Progress)
This car rental website, developed with Angular for the frontend and MySQL for the database, allows users to easily browse a range of vehicles, compare prices, and select rental dates for their chosen car. The platform is designed to streamline the rental process by providing a user-friendly interface where customers can view detailed information about each vehicle, filter based on preferences, and make informed decisions.

Features in development include:

User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users.
Vehicle Browsing: An organized catalog with vehicle details, images, and pricing.
Price Comparison: Quick comparison tools to help users find the best option.
Rental Date Selection: Intuitive calendar for selecting pickup and return dates.
Future enhancements will include payment processing, reservation management, and administrative tools for managing inventory and bookings.
